# Weekly Plan

## Monday

- Learn concepts of authentication, authorization, and their differences
- Different authentication methods (e.g., password-based, token-based, OAuth)
- Basic principles of authorization

## Tuesday

### First Half

- Session management and security. Identify use cases and pros & cons of each authentication methods (i.e. password based, token based, JWT token based). Also study stateful and stateless authentication mechanism.

### Second Half

- Set up a simple authentication system using FastAPI web framework with username/password authentication.
- Use concepts of salting and hashing while storing the passwords in database.

## Wednesday

- Understand Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.
- Implement RBAC in your above authentication model.

## Thursday

- Implement best practices for your authentication mechanism.
- Pair review your code and research more on securing your authentication APIs.
- Perform a security audit on your authentication and authorization system developed until now, identify potential vulnerabilities, and implement necessary fixes.

## Friday

- Implement this authentication model into your library management system.
- Role-based access control for librarian and anyone who wishes to withdraw books/magazines.

**NOTE:** Until Thursday, your authentication/authorization model should be a standalone system. Integrate that sub-system to Library management system on Friday.
